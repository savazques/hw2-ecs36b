Created Classes of Person,Thing,GPS, Time and Record which contained attributes of
objects from Person, Thing, GPS, and Time

Every class contained a dump2JSOn member function that would return the result
of the json values 

Pass the objects into the Record constructor and then call the dump2JSON() 
function of all the record objects which would then call the dump2JSON() functions of the other classes to retireve the json values
and print them to the screen.
